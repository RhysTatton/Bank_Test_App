# Bank_Test_App

Currently a work in progress

This is a basic bank app that uses 2 SQL tables to save users information (username and password) and the tranasaction history 

The user can create an account which saves it to the user table in which the passwords are hashed for data protection. The user then will be able to log in and be able to perform 3 actions, check balance, add funds and transfer funds.
Currently the only functions that are finished are the add funds and check balance for the user.

The goal of this project is to be able to create a web app using Flask which will allow the user to send or recieve funds to a different account.
